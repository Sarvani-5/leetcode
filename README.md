# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This is a collection of solutions to various programming problems that I have solved on LeetCode. The purpose of this repository is to:

1. **Document My Progress:** Keep track of my journey in solving LeetCode problems and improving my coding skills.
2. **Share Knowledge:** Provide a resource for others who may be learning or preparing for coding interviews.
3. **Collaboration:** Encourage collaboration and discussion around different problem-solving approaches.

## How It's Organized

The repository is organized by LeetCode problem categories, making it easy to navigate and find solutions to specific types of problems. Each category contains a set of solutions, and each solution includes a well-documented code file with explanations where necessary.

Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the solutions. Each problem is accompanied by a detailed explanation in the code file itself.

## Contributing

If you find any issues with the solutions, have a more optimized solution, or want to add a new problem, feel free to contribute! Please follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to maintain consistency.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the LeetCode community and all the contributors who have helped me enhance my problem-solving skills.

Happy Coding!
